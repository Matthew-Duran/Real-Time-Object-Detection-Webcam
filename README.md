<h1 align="center">🤖 Real-time Object Detection</h1>

Detecting objects live via webcam with YOLOv8, OpenCV & CVZone

##📖 Overview

This project captures webcam video and performs real-time object detection. Detected objects are displayed with bounding boxes, class names, and confidence scores. It leverages YOLOv8 for detection, OpenCV for video handling, and CVZone for simplified overlay and visualization.

##🚀 Features

Live webcam feed detection

Draws bounding boxes around detected objects

Displays class names and confidence scores

Handles multiple objects simultaneously

Modular code ready for extension to videos, streams, or datasets

##Key highlights:

🔍 Real-time detection – identifies multiple objects in live video

🛠 Computer vision pipeline – video capture → detection → display

⚡ Automation & visualization – bounding boxes, labels, and confidence scores

🌍 Adaptable framework – can integrate into robotics, surveillance, or AI applications
